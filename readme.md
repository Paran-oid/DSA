# Datastructures and algorithms in C

this library contains everything related to the topic "Data Structures and Algorithms" implemented in C by me.

## Side Note:

- functions macros like MIN, MAX, ASSERT can be found in func.h
- logging related code exists in logs directory
- Bewary of dangling pointers, after destroying a queue/array please
  assign your pointers to NULL

## Logger

- To add looging, simply call the function `init_logger(ALL/SESSION)` _ALL to add to all-logs.txt | SESSION for just this session_

---

# For me:

## To memorize:

- 2 4 4 2 structure exists in funcs.h (float and doubles, unsigned ,signed, sizes)
- along with MAX MIN ASSERT

# TODO:

- Make all Data structures and algorithms work WITH GENERICS!!!
- Make sure to add error checking for every malloc and make sure each gets freed
- Make testing functionality
